    <h5><b><u> Direction </u>  </b></h5>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Make fresh paneer using 1-liter milk and 2 tablespoons lemon juice.
            Take a clean muslin cloth or cheesecloth and tie paneer in it. Squeeze it gently to remove excess water
            and hang it over the tap for around 30-45 minutes to drain the excess water.</p></li>
        <li><p> After about 30 minutes, untie the muslin cloth and transfer chhena to a plate.</p></li>
        <li><p> Crumble the paneer with hand. It should be crumbly yet little moist.
            If it has too much moisture, rasmalai may break while cooking.
            To remove excess moisture, press paneer gently between paper napkins.</p></li>
        <li><p> Mash and knead crumbled paneer with hand until it comes together and turns into dough.
            Stop kneading when your palm starts to turn greasy – it will take around 5-8 minutes depending on the
            quality and quantity of paneer prepared from milk. </p></li>
        <li><p>Divide it into 12 equal portions. Make a small ball from each portion, press it gently between your
            palms to flatten it and turn into round pattie as shown it the photo. Pattie should be thick;
            do not press it too much otherwise it may turn thin from sides and it
            will break from sides while cooking. </p></li>
        <li><p>Take 4 cups water and 1½ cups sugar in a deep pan or in a pressure cooker and start to
            heat over medium flame. Stir water with spatula to dissolve the sugar completely.
            When it comes to rolling boil, gently slide all patties (one piece at a time) from the side. </p></li>
        <li><p>Cover pan with a lid (if using pressure cooker, remove whistle and rubber ring from
            the lid and then cover it) and boil for 5-minutes over medium flame. After about 5-minutes,
            open the lid and flip each pattie gently with a spatula. </p></li>
        <li><p>Again, cover with a lid and cook for 7-minutes. Turn off the flame and remove the lid.
            As you can see, size of the pattie increases to almost double after cooking in sugar syrup.
            This is due to paneer absorbing the sugar syrup.</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer it gently to a large bowl and let it cool to room temperature for 1-2 hours. After that
            drain each pattie and press gently between two spoons to remove excess sugar syrup. Be gentle
            while doing this process as it may break if you apply too much pressure.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lets start to make Rabri – pour 1-liter milk in a heavy based pan (thick bottomed pan) and
            heat it over medium flame. When it comes to rolling boil, reduce flame to low and add saffron
            strands.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir at regular intervals in between to prevent sticking and cook until its quantity reduces
            to half; it will take around 15-minutes. You can also cook it over medium flame to speed up the
            process but make sure that milk doesn’t burn and stick at the bottom of the pan; stir frequently
            to prevent it from burning. Mix 1-teaspoon of corn flour with 1 tablespoon water and make sure that it
            doesn’t have any lumps. Add 3-tablespoons sugar, corn flour-water mixture and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
            powder.</p></li>
        <li><p>Increase flame to medium, stir continuously and cook for around 3-4 minutes until sugar dissolves.
            Add drained patties and chopped pistachio.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook for 4-5 minutes. This helps pattie absorb the milk and get the flavor from inside as well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn off the flame and transfer it to serving bowl. Let it cool to room temperature and then
            place it in refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours. Serve chilled rasamalai as a dessert.</p></li>
