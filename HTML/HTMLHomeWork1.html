                      palms to flatten it and turn into round pattie as shown it the photo. Pattie should be thick;
                      do not press it too much otherwise it may turn thin from sides and it

                      This is due to paneer absorbing the sugar syrup.</p></td>

                      to prevent it from burning. Mix 1-teaspoon of corn flour with 1 tablespoon water and make sure that it
                      doesn’t have any lumps. Add 3-tablespoons sugar, corn flour-water mixture and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
